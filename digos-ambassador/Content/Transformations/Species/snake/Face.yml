Flesh twists and pops at the joints of their jaw as it becomes much more flexible and capable, reflexively opening wide to reveal a serpent-like snakes tongue that cautiously tastes the air. Muscles on the back of their neck grow dense and begin to bulge and flare outwards into the shape of a wide hood."
