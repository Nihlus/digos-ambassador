shift_message: "{@target}'s face reshapes with a cracking sound, forming an jagged angular snout covered in {@colour}
                scales. Two horns push through their skin and stretch out behind their heads. {@target}'s eyes widen and
                form a sharper brow while their cheekbones push out a pair of smaller horns. A small elemental breath
                escapes their maw for a brief moment."

grow_message: "{@target}'s blank, featureless face pushes outwards, forming an jagged angular snout. Two horns push
               through their skin and stretch out behind their heads and another pair follow suit from the cheekbones.
               A small elemental breath escapes their maw for a brief moment."

single_description: "{@f|Their} face is a jagged angular snout, with small, slit like nostrils. {@f|Their} rough scales
                     shifts in hues of {@colour} and displace around four horns, two above their head and two from their
                     cheeks. Sometimes, they let loose a small gout of elemental breath."
