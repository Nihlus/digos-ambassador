# DIGOS Ambassador
Travis CI: ![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/Nihlus/digos-ambassador.svg?branch=master)

This readme is under construction. The DIGOS Ambassador is a utility Discord bot originally created for the DIGOS / 
Transformation Discord chat for use with preference tracking, RP synchronization, games, character recordkeeping, et cetera.

Some of the portions of this bot may contain explicit content, due to the nature of the community it was written for. Please be aware of this while browsing the source code.

### Usage
Amby can be added to your Discord server by clicking this badge, or by hosting your own instance and adding her 
yourself. By default, she doesn't request any special permissions. However, some of her features won't be completely 
functional without them. A complete list will be made available soon; for now, she'll tell you.
