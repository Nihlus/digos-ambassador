# DIGOS Ambassador
Travis CI: ![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/Nihlus/digos-ambassador.svg?branch=master)

This readme is under construction. The DIGOS Ambassador is a utility Discord bot originally created for the DIGOS / 
Transformation Discord chat for use with preference tracking, RP synchronization, games, character recordkeeping, et cetera.

Some of the portions of this bot may contain explicit content, due to the nature of the community it was written for. Please be aware of this while browsing the source code.

### Usage
Amby can be added to your Discord server by clicking this badge, or by hosting your own server and adding her
yourself.
[![Invite Amby](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite%20Amby-Discord-5C0298.svg)](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=375021645074530305&scope=bot)

By default, she doesn't request any special permissions. However, some of her features won't be completely 
functional without them. Below is a list of those special permissions needed; she will ask for them when you try to set her up on a server.

### Permissions
Amby bot has a few special permissions that she needs to be able to work 100%, this list is a guide to what special permissions she needs:

manage roles: for when you want to allow amby to change your role when you assume a character or delete said role when you unassume a character ie: dragon, fox, drone etc. 

Note: the roles you want her to manage need to be BELOW her own role in your roles page; if they are above her own and you dont give amby administrator amby will be unable to assign roles that are higher than her own

manage channels: this is used for setting up rp channels; and allowing the channels to be hidden to others if need be

manage nicknames: used when amby changes your username to assume another character

read text and see voice channels: mostly used for see text channels; to allow you to use bot commands

manage messages: allows amby to use a quoting feature that deletes a messages link and instead posts the message herself

### Abilities/Uses
